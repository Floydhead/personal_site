I am a Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University pursuing a degree in Information Systems Management with a concentration in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. I seek to apply a blend of computer science and management practices to improve businesses or benefit governments and their allied organizations.


I believe that mathematics is the fundamental principle of the universe and statistics can be applied to improve, predict, or innovate processes leading to global prosperity.


I am currently interning at Van Eck, an Investment Management Firm based out of Manhattan, New York where I work as a Data Engineer. In my free time, I attempt to learn and solve cases using Machine Learning, enjoy sessions of FIFA on my computer, or play the Guitar.
